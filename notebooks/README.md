# Jupyter Notebooks for running AusEFlux

`annual_update`: Notebooks in this folder describe the methods for creating quasi-operational annual carbon and water fluxes. Use these notebooks if your goal is to generate annual fluxes for the past year.

`historical`: Notebooks in this folder decribe the methods for creating historical carbon and water fluxes for Australia through the full length of the MODIS archive (i.e., 2003-present). These notebooks are similar to the `annual_update` folder, but optimised for the task of running 20+ years of predictions and the attendent complications that come with acquiring, harmonising, and predicting a full archive of data.
