# Jupyter notebooks for running historical predictions of AusEFlux

Notebooks in this folder describe the methods for creating long-term historical gridded predictions of carbon and water fluxes for Australia. Use these notebooks if your goal is to generate fluxes for the full MODIS archive (i.e., 2003-2022). The notebooks are numbered in sequential order of their operation.

**Ideal compute environment:**
